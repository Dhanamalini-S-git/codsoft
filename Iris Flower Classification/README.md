The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning problem that focuses on classifying iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their physical characteristics.

The dataset contains four key features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

In this project, the data is first cleaned and explored using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships between features. Then, feature scaling and preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the data for modeling.

Multiple machine learning classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree are trained and evaluated. Model performance is measured using accuracy and classification metrics to identify the best-performing model.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of supervised learning, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, making it an ideal beginner-friendly machine learning project.
