Project Description

The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on historical passenger data using machine learning techniques. This project helps in understanding how factors such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and family size influenced survival chances.
The dataset includes features such as:

Passenger Class (Pclass)
Sex
Age
Fare

Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)
Embarked location
The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to identify patterns and relationships between passenger features and survival outcomes. Data visualization techniques are used to gain meaningful insights.

Classification models such as Logistic Regression are implemented to predict survival outcomes. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and other classification metrics.This project demonstrates practical knowledge of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and classification modeling, which are fundamental concepts in data science.
